# 🚀 ML-Library

### Hardware-Agnostic Machine Learning Powered by Pure Python

This library is being developed as an open-source alternative to the proprietary ecosystems of major manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD (CUDA/ROCm). Our mission is to leverage the power of **PyOpenCL** to provide a flexible, modular machine learning infrastructure that delivers high performance regardless of your hardware brand.

## 🌟 Why This Library?

Today’s machine learning landscape is often restricted to specific hardware ecosystems. This project aims to break those boundaries:

* **Hardware Freedom:** Achieve full performance on any GPU (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) via PyOpenCL integration.
* **The Power of Pure Python:** The core architecture is built entirely in Python, making it transparent, readable, and highly extensible.
* **Future Vision:** While currently in an experimental stage (undergoing optimization), our goal is to achieve maximum speed and a simplified API that even end-users can deploy with ease.
